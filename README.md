# FamilyFacts
The aim of this project is to provide a cross-platform application for managing genealogical research. There are already many programs available to do this, however most of the software is specific to Windows. Some open source applications are available but are either web-based or written in a scripting language such as Python which is problematic to maintain in the longterm and not as efficient as a program written in a compiled language.

We plan to use the following libraries:
- For GEDCOM: https://github.com/frizbog/gedcom4j
- For the GUI: http://www.miglayout.com/
